# Lending-Club-Loan-Default-Prediction-
This repository contains a group project on Lending Club Loan Default Prediction. The project aimed to predict high-risk loan applicants to reduce potential credit losses. The team cleaned and analyzed loan data from 2007-2011 using Pandas, addressing missing values and outliers. Extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to identify key factors such as loan term, income, and credit inquiries that are linked to defaults. The insights generated from this analysis were used to enhance loan approval processes and minimize financial risks. The repository includes the complete codebase, data processing steps, model development, and key findings, offering a robust solution for predicting loan defaults.
